# React Chess

Chess, made in React with a Ruby on Rails backend.
The backend is available [Here](https://github.com/Ryhu/React-Chess-api).


## Getting Started

Clone down both this repo and the [backend](https://github.com/Ryhu/React-Chess-api)
For the game, run
```
npm install && npm start
```

on a separate terminal tab, navigate to the backend repo and run
```
rails s
```

the npm install takes a while, but when it completes, your web browser should have a new window with the game running.
